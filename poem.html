      <h1>My Very First Best Friend</h1>
      <p>I was the only child, until back in July of ‘88</p>
      <p>I didn’t know it then, but I just met my very first best friend</p>
      <p>First we played with all of my toys, and we made a lot of noise</p>
      <p>I’m sure we weren’t the easiest to raise, or so said our parent’s gaze</p>
      <p>There was wrestling moves in the living room, choke slams and figure 4s</p>
      <p>I’m sorry I beat up on you, but I myself was just a boy</p>
      <p>We were such lucky little lads, we had the best mum and dad</p>
      <p>After all, how many kids grow up next to a 20 acre office park</p>
      <p>From flying kites, and playing catch, riding bikes, and even some fetch (with our dog Mars)</p>
      <p>We even had to of had, the very first laser tag</p>
      <p>And maybe coolest of all, our own treehouse, custom built by dad</p>
      <p>There was Boy Scouts, and camp outs, sleeping in tents, and on and on it went</p>
      <p>And then there was the Cape, where we vacationed so many years</p>
      <p>We’d bicker driving up, and bury each other in sand</p>
      <p>And how about that time, when we walked across a jetti</p>
      <p>That dad had you and I believing, we had just arrived in Serengeti</p>
      <p><em>(actually, it was England, but it’s hard to rhyme with “jetti”)</em></p>
      <p>Remember all our pets, far too many to name, except that Molly always was your favorite dame</p>
      <p>Then off I went to college, and we began to drift apart</p>
      <p>It’s not like we were perfect brothers then, but I loved you all the same</p>
      <p>As you became a man, some demons grabbed ahold</p>
      <p>Rough years were ahead, and some days it was tough for you to get out of bed</p>
      <p>But not without a fight, you would again and again find the light</p>
      <p>I am so proud of you, the strength that you’d show</p>
      <p>You found some things that made you happy, but never without a battle</p>
      <p>Video games, outdoor hikes, jigsaw puzzles, and fishing for pike</p>
      <p>You stood next to me as I got married, and handed me our rings</p>
      <p>You helped me sell my house, and then cleaning out my yard</p>
      <p>Our relationship was not without its strain, but today is not about the rain</p>
      <p>Now you are an uncle, to my little baby girl</p>
      <p>I’m sad today for that, she will never remember you in this world</p>
      <p>But I swear to you today, she will know about you, Joe</p>
      <p>Your kindness, compassion and your perseverance, and how I love you so</p>
      <p>May you rest easy now my brother, until we meet again</p>
      <p>You will forever be, my very first best friend</p>
      <br />
