              <p>Joseph Francis Pagini, 34, tragically succumbed to his addiction battle on Saturday, October 15th, 2022. Joey was born to Janet and Donald Pagini on July 8th, 1988, at the Meriden-Wallingford Hospital. He was their 2nd son and would complete their perfect little family. Joey grew up on Preston Avenue, attending school at Mount Carmel, Nathan Hale, Thomas Edison and Wilcox Tech, and most recently living on Paddock Avenue. He was at his happiest with tight lines (fishing) on the CT/RI shoreline, waiting for the next big catch, or just generally enjoying the outdoors. He would often go hiking to help clear his mind, especially around Giuffrida Park. He was presently pursuing a career as a tower technician at the Pinnacle Career Institute. Joe was an incredibly hard-working individual and kindhearted. His family will forever miss Christmas mornings with Joe, where it is tradition to clean up used wrapping paper by crinkling it up and throwing it at the most unsuspecting family member.</p>
              <p>He is survived by his parents, Janet and Donald Pagini of Meriden, and brother David and sister-in-law Rebecca Macfarlane. He was also a very proud first-time uncle to Amelia Pagini, whom he loved dearly. He also leaves behind numerous loving aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>
              <p>His family will receive relatives and friends on Thursday, October 20th from 4 to 7 p.m. at the John J. Ferry & Sons Funeral Home, 88 E. Main St., Meriden. Everyone is invited to attend a Mass of Christian Burial to be held on Friday, October 21st at 10 a.m. at Our Lady Queen of Angels Parish, Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church, 109 Goodwill Ave., Meriden. Burial will follow in St. Stanislaus Cemetery.</p>

          <p>Below is a poem, written by Joseph's brother, and read during his eulogy. It is being shared here in Joey's memory.</p>
          <h2>My Very First Best Friend</h2>

          <div class="poem">
            <p>I was the only child, until back in July of ‘88</p>
            <p>I didn’t know it then, but I just met my very first best friend</p>
            <p>First we played with all of my toys, and we made a lot of noise</p>
            <p>I’m sure we weren’t the easiest to raise, or so said our parent’s gaze</p>
            <p>There was wrestling moves in the living room, choke slams and figure 4s</p>
            <p>I’m sorry I beat up on you, but I myself was just a boy</p>
            <p>We were such lucky little lads, we had the best mum and dad</p>
            <p>After all, how many kids grow up next to a 20 acre office park</p>
            <p>From flying kites, and playing catch, riding bikes, and even some fetch (with our dog Mars)</p>
            <p>We even had to of had, the very first laser tag</p>
            <p>And maybe coolest of all, our own treehouse, custom built by dad</p>
            <p>There was Boy Scouts, and camp outs, sleeping in tents, and on and on it went</p>
            <p>And then there was the Cape, where we vacationed so many years</p>
            <p>We’d bicker driving up, and bury each other in sand</p>
            <p>And how about that time, when we walked across a jetti</p>
            <p>That dad had you and I believing, we had just arrived in Serengeti</p>
            <p><em>(actually, it was England, but it’s hard to rhyme with “jetti”)</em></p>
            <p>Remember all our pets, far too many to name, except that Molly always was your favorite dame</p>
            <p>Then off I went to college, and we began to drift apart</p>
            <p>It’s not like we were perfect brothers then, but I loved you all the same</p>
            <p>As you became a man, some demons grabbed ahold</p>
            <p>Rough years were ahead, and some days it was tough for you to get out of bed</p>
            <p>But not without a fight, you would again and again find the light</p>
            <p>I am so proud of you, the strength that you’d show</p>
            <p>You found some things that made you happy, but never without a battle</p>
            <p>Video games, outdoor hikes, jigsaw puzzles, and fishing for pike</p>
            <p>You stood next to me as I got married, and handed me our rings</p>
            <p>You helped me sell my house, and then cleaning out my yard</p>
            <p>Our relationship was not without its strain, but today is not about the rain</p>
            <p>Now you are an uncle, to my little baby girl</p>
            <p>I’m sad today for that, she will never remember you in this world</p>
            <p>But I swear to you today, she will know about you, Joe</p>
            <p>Your kindness, compassion and your perseverance, and how I love you so</p>
            <p>May you rest easy now my brother, until we meet again</p>
            <p>You will forever be, my very first best friend</p>
            <br />
            <p>~ David Pagini ~</p>
